# CODTECH Internship – Task 4: Sentiment Analysis using NLP

## ✅ Overview
As part of Task 4 during my Data Analysis Internship at **CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS**, I built a sentiment analysis model to classify airline tweets as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**.

The notebook demonstrates the full Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow, from data cleaning to vectorization and model evaluation using **Naive Bayes**.
